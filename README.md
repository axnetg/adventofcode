# Axnetg's Advent of Code

This repository contains my implementations of the challenges from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), an annual series of programming puzzles designed to test problem-solving skills and creativity.

I like to use LINQ to simplify looping logic and records to make the code more concise. While my solutions might not always be the cleanest or most polished, my focus is on correctness and brevity over maintainability, reflecting my current C# skills.

Each challenge solution is implemented in its own class, with one method for part one and another for part two of the puzzle.

This is a console application written in C#. Its sole purpose is to print the solutions to Advent of Code challenges.

```
